## Abstract

> The original study is one of the first sub-national geographic vulnerability models for a developing country, Malawi. A main contribution of the study is to establish a replicable methodology for climate change vulnerability modeling in Africa using readily available datasets. At the outset of a larger project on reproducibility and replicability in the human-environment and geographic sciences, we chose this study to reproduce on account of its stated contributions and straightforward multi-criteria analysis methodology. As a reproduction study, we aimed to independently generate identical results from the original publication. We found an exact reproduction to be impossible due to ambiguities in the narrative methodology and undesirable due to conceptual and methodological uncertainties. We therefore complete a reanalysis of the original study with intentional deviations from the original methodology. We also devise a methodology for digitizing and quantitatively comparing choropleth maps of the original study with the reanalysis study.
